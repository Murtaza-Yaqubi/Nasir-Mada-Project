  title     = "National tuberculosis prevalence surveys 2007-2016",
  abstract  = "Between 2007 and the end of 2016, 24 countries implemented a
               total of 25 national tuberculosis prevalence surveys using
               methods recommended by WHO. The 25 surveys consisted of 13 in
               Asia and 12 in Africa. Collectively, survey findings have
               informed the policies, plans and programmatic actions needed to
               address gaps in TB diagnosis and treatment and to reduce the
               burden of TB disease. Finally, the 24 countries have a robust
               baseline for assessing progress towards new global targets set
               in the UN Sustainable Development Goals (2016--2030) and WHO's
               End TB Strategy (2016--2035). The methods, results, successes
               achieved, challenges faced and lessons learned from the 25
               surveys were comprehensively documented in the book. We viewed
               such a product as a global public good, that should be available
               to all those with an interest in and commitment to using survey
               findings, now and in the future e.g. academics, donors, public
               health officers and national TB programmes. As with
               implementation of the 25 surveys themselves, the book is the
               result of a major global, regional and national collaborative
               and collective effort, with more than 450 contributors from all
               around the world.",
