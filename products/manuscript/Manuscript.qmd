# Introduction

## General Background Information

Tuberculosis is old infectious disease which still exists and become
major public health in the world, particularly in developing countries.
Tuberculosis is linked to environmental factors. This study will analyze
the effects of multi environmental factors on tuberculosis incidence in
Asia and Africa regions, where the majority of tuberculosis coming from
these regions. The environmental factors and country economic and human
development index as covariates.

## Description of data and data source

The study will use multi sources of data including World Bank, World
Health Organization (WHO), United Nation for Children Fund (Unicef),
UN-HABITAT, Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR),
and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME). Different
dataset contains different variable, however all dataset have same year,
country name and country codes that can be used to combine the dataset.
The data also contain information of countries globally from 2000 to
2020. The variables will include proportion of urban population living
in slum areas, percentage of population using safely managed sanitation
services, percentage of population using at least basic drinking water
service, fuel for cooking, Population-weighted exposure to ambient PM2.5
pollution, total green houses, and will include GDP/ country economic
status, human development index, and Universal Health Coverage as
covariates.

Note: I have downloaded the dataset, but I have not conducted any
cleaning or exploration on the dataset. List of data sources and website
is provided in an excel fine in my data folder. I will include them in
my reference for the next steps.

# Methods

The datasets were loded one by one, then drop all unused variable before
comined those datasets using reduce() function. Countries, which have at
least one missing years from 2000 to 2020, were dropped from the study.
To make sure that the data is clean and ready to analyse, all missing
values were dropped. This study focuses on South East Asia and Africa
Regions, where the major proportion of tuberculosis cases came.
Therefore, a newsubset for South East Asia and African countries was
created.

After data cleaning, multiple exploratory data analysis was forformed
such us summary and vizualising the data. A bloxplot was created to show
Tuberculosis Incidence in each country during the time frame. Spagheti
plot was created to visualize the trend of tuberculosis incidence and
other variables over the time. Lastly, line charts showing the trend of
all variables in each country.

The exploratory data analysis showed that the data were not normally
distributed and there was no linear relationship between tuberculosis
incidence and other predictors. Therefore, Spearman's correlation matrix
was perfomed to see the correlations. To have better understanding, a
heatmap matrix plot was created to show the correlation.

The main statistical analysis in thie study is longitudinal data
analysis (eithre fixed effect or mixed effect method). To see which one
is better, Hausman Test was performed to determine which model is
better.

NOTE: I still need to discuss and need more advice about the data
analysis from Dr. Handel

## Schematic of workflow

NOTE: I AM STILL WORKING TO FIGUR THIS ONE OUT Sometimes you might want
to show a schematic diagram/figure that was not created with code (if
you can do it with code, do it). @fig-schematic is an example of some -
completely random/unrelated - schematic that was generated with
Biorender. We store those figures in the `assets` folder.

```{r}
#| label: fig-schematic
#| fig-cap: "A figure that is manually generated and shows some overview/schematic. This has nothing to do with the data, it's just a random one from one of our projects I found and placed here."
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("assets","antigen-recognition.png"))

## Data aquisition

Most of the data is downloaded from Worlbank Dataset. However, those
data are originally from many different courses/ organizations, such as
World Bank, WHA, UNICEF, UN-HABITAT, EDGAR, and IHME.

## Data import and cleaning

Data Import and data cleaning process have been explained in the methode
part. To see the code for data import and data cleaning , please visit
working directory ("code", "processing-code", "processingfile.qdm").
Processed and clean data are saved at a folder ("data",
"processed-data"). There are many .rds files in the folder icnlduing
file for each variables, and file after combined all variables.

Dataset are either in excel or CSV files. Several steps from loading to
data analysis:

-   to load the data set in this part using read_excel or read_csv.

-   to combine them base on country name/ code and years.

-   to drop unwanted variables

-   to select Asian and African Countries only

-   to drop N/A or missing value

-   to conduct data exploration

-   to decide suitable analysis method

-   to perform data analysis

# Results

## Exploratory/Descriptive analysis

There are some exploratory data analysis conducted and resulted table,
and charts. Table 1 shows the summary statistics including min, mean,
max, and standard deviation of all variables.

NOTE: I still have issue in saving the stiled tables. I am still working
on it. I will show it next step.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-summarytable
#| tbl-cap: "Data summary table."
#| echo: FALSE
resulttable=readRDS("../../results/tables/summarytable.rds")
knitr::kable(resulttable)
```

The line graph ( @fig-1 ) shows the trend of all variables over the
period in each country. It can be seen that the majority of country
showed the decreases trend in tuberculosis incidence over 21 years
period, except Lesotho showing a sharp increase until the middle of the
period before dramatic decrease until the end of the period. All
countries showed the increase trend in percentage of population using
using basic and safe drinking water, basic and safe sanitation, and
clean fuel and technology for cooking, except Zimbabuwe showing the
decrease in percentage of population using basic drinking water and safe
sanitation, and Senegal showing the decrease of population using clean
fuel and technology for cooking.

```{r}

#| label: fig-1
#| fig-cap: "Trends of all variable over the period in each country"
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("code","eda-code","figures","line-graph-tbivsfactors.png"))

```

( @fig-2 ) shows spaghetti plots in each variables. We can see the
trends of each country in every variables. It can be seen that generally
most of the countries show the increase trends in water and sanitation,
clean fuel use, human development index, total greenhouses, but
fluctuated trends in mean of PM2.5 expousures.

```{r}

#| label: fig-2
#| fig-cap: "Spaghetti plots in each variables"
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("code","eda-code","figures","spageti.png"))

```

Now lets take a more detail tuberculosis incidence in each country over
the year using the following box plot. Lesotho leads the incidence
followed by Myanmar and Tanzania.

```{r}

#| label: fig-3
#| fig-cap: "Spaghetti plots in each variables"
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("code","eda-code","figures","boxplot.png"))

```



## Basic statistical analysis

As first step of statistical analysis. Using scatterplot to show the linearity between tuberculosis incidence and predictors. ( @fig-4 ) shows the scatterplots. The scatterplots do not show linear relationship between tuberculosis Incidence and predictors. 


```{r}

#| label: fig-4
#| fig-cap: "Scatter plots between Tuberculosis Incidence and Predictors "
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("code","eda-code","figures","scatterplot.png"))

```
Before going further, we need to look at correlation between tuberculosis Incidence and all predictors. 

Since they show nonlinearity, spearman's correlation performed and hsowing in the following correlation matrix. See ( @fig-5 )

```{r}


#| label: fig-5
#| fig-cap: "Spearman Correlation Matrix "
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("code","eda-code","figures","correlation_matrix.png"))

```


Since there is no linear relationship, nonlinear relationship test was performed. 

```{r}

#| label: fig-6
#| fig-cap: "Nonlinear relationship"
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("code","analysis-code","figures","nonlinear.png"))


```

After performing nonlinear model, data transformation used based on the shave or distribution of the plots from nonlinear relationship plots ( @fig-6 ) above. ( @fig-7 ) shows the data distribution after data transformation. 


```{r}

#| label: fig-7
#| fig-cap: "transformed data plots"
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("code","analysis-code","figures","transformed.png"))


```



## Full analysis

For the final model, Generalized linear models (GLMs) and Generalized Addictive Models (GAMs). I need to discuss with Dr. Handal to get advice about this. 


I actually have performed both GLMs and GAMs, but I still need to learn both models in depth. Specially for GAM, I am very new in the models. Initially I performed GLMs since the Transformed plots show linears line, but aftrer comparing the GLMs and GAMs model, GAMs perfoming better. 





Example @tbl-resulttable2 shows a summary of a linear model fit.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-resulttable2
#| tbl-cap: "Linear model fit table."
#| echo: FALSE
resulttable2 = readRDS(here("results","tables","resulttable2.rds"))
knitr::kable(resulttable2)
```
