# Template structure and content

The template comes with a folder structure and example files to illustrative the kinds of content you would place in the different folders. The following is a brief description of the contents. See the `readme` files in each folder for more details.


* The `assets` folder contains files that I might need for the project

* All code goes into the `code` folder and sub-folders. Currently, there are 3 sub-folders that do different parts of an analysis; processing-code for data processing, eda-code for exploratory data analysis, and analysis-code for main analaysis and modeling. 

* All data goes into the `data` folder and sub-folders. Currently, there are 2 sub-folders that contain different versions of a simple example data set. You can re-organize such that it makes most sense for your project. 

* The `products` folder and its subfolders contains  manuscript/report

* The `results` folder contains automatically/code generated output. This includes figures and tables. All figures are in .png, and tables are in .Rds. In the folder, there are several sub-folders: figures for all figures, tables for tables, and large file. All sub-folders contain sub-folders showing the source of the tables or figurs, either from eda or analysis process. 

* There are multiple special files in the repo.
  * `readme.md`: this file contains instructions or details about the folder it
  is located in. You are reading the project-level `README.md` file right now. There is a `readme` in almost every folder.
  * `data-analysis-template.Rproj` is a file that tells RStudio that this is the main folder for a project. Rename if you want.
  * a few "hidden" files and folders (they start with a `.` and depending on how your OS is configured, you might not see them). Those are for R/RStudio and Git/GitHub and you can ignore them.
